# Privacy Policy for Kindness Agent

**Last updated:** 1 December 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Kindness Agent (“we,” “us,” “our”) handles information when you interact with the agent. Kindness Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to offer kindness suggestions, messages, reflections, and creative ideas to support positive interactions and emotional well-being.
We value your privacy and aim to be transparent about how your information is processed.

## 1. Information We Collect

We do not collect or store personal information about you.

However, when you interact with the Kindness Agent, the following information may be processed temporarily to generate a reply:

The text you type into the agent

Optional details you choose to share (example: “this is for my friend,” “my coworker was promoted,” “I feel stressed today”)

This information is used only during your active session and is not stored by us.

## 2. How Your Information Is Used

Your inputs are used solely to:

- Generate kindness suggestions
- Provide message ideas, reflections, or gift recommendations
- Improve the helpfulness of the response the agent provides

We do not:

- Store your conversations
- Build user profiles
- Sell or share your information
- Use your information for marketing or advertising
- All processing is done through trusted third-party AI systems, which may temporarily retain data per their own policies.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The Kindness Agent uses AI models and infrastructure provided by:

- OpenAI (for language processing)
- SmythOS (for agent orchestration)
- Lovable or other hosting providers (if applicable)

These providers may temporarily retain or process data to maintain system functionality and security.
Their own privacy policies govern how they handle data.

We do not control or override their data retention practices.

## 4. Data Security

Although we do not store user data ourselves, third-party platforms used by the Kindness Agent employ industry-standard security protections.

However, because this is a conversational AI tool, you should not share sensitive personal information, including:

- Medical or mental health details
- Financial information
- Legal or confidential data
- Home address or precise location
- Passwords or login details

If sensitive data is shared accidentally, it is processed only temporarily and not stored by us.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The Kindness Agent is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect or store personal information from children.

## 6. Your Choices and Control

Since we do not store personal data:

- There is no account to delete
- There is no saved data to access, modify, or remove
- Closing your session ends all processing on our side

Please note that third-party platforms (OpenAI, SmythOS, etc.) may retain logs as part of their system operations.

## 7. AI Limitations

The Kindness Agent is a tool for ideas, positivity, and encouragement. It is not a substitute for professional help.

Do not rely on the Kindness Agent for:

- Medical advice
- Mental health diagnosis or treatment
- Legal or financial decisions
- Crisis intervention or emergencies

If you are facing an emergency, contact local emergency services or a qualified professional immediately.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.
The updated version will be posted with a new “Last updated” date.
